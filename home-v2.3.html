  <div class="container">
    <p>If you aren’t online these days, your business is losing out on a <strong>TON</strong> of revenues, customers and profits, but the truth is, if you aren’t getting any customers to your website, why bother having a website? It’d be like having a shop that never gets any visitors... Pretty pointless.</p>
    <p>Getting a local website to appear high in the search engine rankings is a difficult job at best, it's incredibly time consuming, very technical in nature, and the path to get there is forever changing.</p>
    <p>But that's the #1 reason we're in business …</p>

        <p>That's what we do - we implement strategies on your behalf, that catapult your website up to the top spots for major search engines, which results in <strong>more customers walking through your door, or picking up the phone to call you.</strong></p>
        <p> Most business owners, like yourself, are great at converting leads into sales when the customers visit their location or call - but the hardest part is getting them to call or visit in the first place!</p>

      <li class="right">
        <img src="img/rounded-image-2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
        <p>You can advertise in local or regional newspapers, direct mail campaigns or do telemarketing - but let’s face it, digital search is <i>the</i> place to look - why bother with these outdated and often expensive methods, that don’t have anywhere near the high conversion rates that local SEO can provide?</p>
